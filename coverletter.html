  <h2>Cover Letter</h2> <!-- Cover Letter -->
  <p> I am in my senior year here at Hofstra University and am majoring in Information Systems and Business Analytics. I have worked for the Bank of New York Mellon as a business analyst intern, creating meaningful and insightful analyses using Power BI and SQL. I standardized reports for the whole bank, automated reporting software, taking reporting time from two hours to ten seconds, and imported thousands of rows from excel to create a time metric analysis for BNY's automation system, putting a cost-benefit study to our system. I also have been working as an IT Technician for Hofstra law school and have learned a lot about how to deal with people and adapt to a new environment. I have also worked as a student aide in the Zarb deans' office, gathering and using data to see new viewpoints and discuss new ways to move on.</p>

  <p> My goal is to obtain new experiences, with an internship or not, to understand the business world better, or to shadow your daily activities. I appreciate your stringent work schedule, but I was hoping you could look at my resume or even have a chat sometime as I would love to get to know more about how I can frame myself better for Business professionals. An industry professional's input means the world. Once again, I want to thank you for your time and express my appreciation. </p>
